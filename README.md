# 🖥️ Windows Server 2019 Infrastructure Project

## 🧩 Overview
Designed and deployed a Windows Server 2019 infrastructure for a simulated organization with two sites (Tel Aviv and New York).  
Configured AD DS, DNS, and DHCP Failover between sites to ensure network availability.  
Created a structured OU hierarchy, automated user and group creation with PowerShell, and implemented password and lockout policies.  
Deployed a File Server Failover Cluster using iSCSI storage and DFS Replication for high availability.
